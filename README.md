# ExamplePSet

This is an example of a slide deck I created as part of a project for a Dataa Analysis course in Spring 2023.
The assignment asaked us to collect data and blah blahh.

My project looks at the relationshiip between these thiings and those other things. I gathered data from whatever. I did A, B, and C to clean it. Brag about the data cleaning step. 

Files for the project:
- 'my data.csv' replication data
- 'slidescript.Rmd' coode for creating the slides
- 'index.html' with the ouutput

See the slides at URL.
